# 4 AXI Transaction
-  The AXI protocol uses transactions for communication between Managers and Subordinates.
- All transactions include a request and a response. Write and read transactions also include one or more data transfers.
- This chapter describes the transaction requests, responses, and data transfers.
- It contains the following sections:
  - A4.1 Transaction request
  - A4.2 Write and read data
  - A4.3 Transaction response

## 4.1 Transaction request :
  - An AXI master initiates a transaction by issuing a request to a slave.
  - A request includes transaction attributes and the address of the first data transfer.
  - If the transaction includes more than one data transfer, the Subordinate must calculate the addresses of subsequent transfers.
  - A transaction must not cross a 4KB address boundary. This prevents a transaction from crossing a boundary between two Subordinates.
  - It also limits the number of address increments that a Subordinate must support.
  - AxSIZE   : Size indicates the maximum number of bytes in each data transfer.
  - AxLEN    : The Length attribute defines the number of data transfers in a transaction.
  - AxBURST  : how the address increments between transfers in a transaction. (FIXED, INCR, WRAP)
### 4.1.1 Size attribute
  - Size indicates the maximum number of bytes in each data transfer.
  - For read transactions, Size indicates how many data bytes must be valid in each read data transfer.
  - For write transactions, Size indicates how many data byte lanes are permitted to be active.
  - The write strobes indicate which of those bytes are valid in each transfer.
  - Size must not exceed the data width of an interface, as determined by the DATA_WIDTH property.
  - If Size is smaller than DATA_WIDTH, a subset of byte lanes is used for each transfer.
  - Size is communicated using the AWSIZE and ARSIZE signals on the write request and read request channels, respectively.
  - In this specification, AxSIZE indicates AWSIZE and ARSIZE.

  - The property SIZE_Present is used to determine if the AxSIZE signals are present.
  - SIZE_Present  : True Means Size is present , False means Not present

# 4 Address
## 4.1 About addressing options
  - The AXI protocol is burst-based, and the master begins each burst by driving transfer control information and the address of the first byte in the transfer.
  - As the burst transaction progresses, it is the responsibility of the slave to calculate the addresses of subsequent transfers in the burst.
  - Bursts must not cross 4KB boundaries to prevent them from crossing boundaries between slaves and to limit the size of the address incrementer required within slaves.
## 4.2 Burst size
  - Table 4-2 shows how the ARSIZE or AWSIZE signal specifies the maximum number of data bytes to transfer in each beat, or data transfer, within a burst.
  - The AXI determines from the transfer address which byte lanes of the data bus to use for each transfer.
  - For incrementing or wrapping bursts with transfer sizes narrower than the data bus, data transfers are on different byte lanes for each beat of the burst.
  - The address of a fixed burst remains constant, and every transfer uses the same byte lanes.
  - The size of any transfer must not exceed the data bus width of the components in the transaction.

## 4.3 Burst length
  - The AWLEN or ARLEN signal specifies the number of data transfers that occur within each burst.
  - As Table 4-1 shows, each burst can be 1-16 transfers long.
  - For wrapping bursts, the length of the burst must be 2, 4, 8, or 16 transfers.

## 4.5 Wrap Address Calculation
  **Data** 
    - AWSIZE = 2 
    - AWLEN  = 3
    - AWBURST = 2 (Wrap)
    - Start_addr = 0x1004

  **Calculation**   
    - No_of_bytes = 2 ^ AWSIZE = 2 ^ 2 = 4 byte  
    - burst_len = AWLEN + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 transfer  
    - total_no_byte_in_burst = No_of_bytes * burst_len = 4 * 4 = 16 bytes  
    
    - Lower_Boundary = (INT(Start_Address / (Number_Bytes x Burst_Length))) x (Number_Bytes x Burst_Length)  
    - Upper_Boundary = = Lower_Boundary + (Number_Bytes x Burst_Length)
